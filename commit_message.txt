feat: Implement interactive academic year Gantt chart web app

This commit introduces the initial version of the interactive academic year Gantt chart web application.

Key features include:
- Frontend built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js, and Vanilla JavaScript.
- Backend powered by Google Firebase (Firestore for data persistence, Firebase Authentication for anonymous user sessions).
- Core visualization of academic activities on a horizontal timeline (Gantt chart) and a detailed list view.
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing activities.
- Filtering by category and searching for activities.
- Real-time updates across all active users.
- Initial data seeding on first use.

Firebase configuration and security rules are set up to allow authenticated users to read and write academic event data.
