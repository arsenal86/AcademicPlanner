Set up Firebase:

Create a new project in the Firebase Console.

Create a firestore.rules file with the following rules to allow read and write access for authenticated users:

rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {

    projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
};
Deploy the project:
